I am a fifth-year PhD student in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/) advised by [Gina-Anne Levow](https://faculty.washington.edu/levow/), [Richard Wright](https://depts.washington.edu/phonlab/rawright.php), and [Eleanor Chodroff](https://www.eleanorchodroff.com/). 
Generally, I am interested in multilingual NLP and speech processing, low-resource language technology, language variation, and linguistic typology. 
The goal of my work is to enhance the accessibility of modern NLP and speech technologies to diverse communities.
<!-- , specifically in  -->
By understanding how sounds and sound systems systematically vary in the increasingly large corpora across the world's languages, we can contribute to the fields of phonetic and phonological typology, as well as broaden the technologies that mainly serve higher-resourced and mainstream varieties of language.
<!-- the systematic phonetic and phonological variations 
by incorporating konwledge of phonetic and phonological typology

Recently, I have been analyzing the use of phonological categories in cross-lingual phonemic forced alignment.

<!-- My previous research involved investigating accommodation in code-switched dialogues, and I have been supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).  -->
Through the support of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), some of my past projects include analyzing acoustic word embeddindgs of multilingual named entities, investigating accommodation in code-switched dialogues, and detecting microaggressions in social media text.
I have completed my Masters at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Alan Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) and [Yulia Tsvetkov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/). 
Before any graduate studies, I spent 1 year at SRI International, working in their Speech Technology and Research Lab. 
Prior to that, I graduated from Wellesley College in 2016, where I studied Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences with a concentration in Computer Science.
I encourage students to contact me with questions about Computational Linguistics, NLP, graduate school, applications, etc---just email me!

When I'm not working, I like to crochet, knit, play drums, exercise, listen to jazz, and most of all share meals and conversations with friends. Once upon a time, I did taekwondo and rowing for sport.
